How to build better tools for our teams
---------------------------------------

Simple ways to build tools — whenever possible, you want the process to be implemented by a tool rather than by hand.

This makes things easy and also allows us to be consistent. Processes gradually diverege otherwise. When our processes are encoded in tools, we avoid this problem.

APIs! They're a thing.
