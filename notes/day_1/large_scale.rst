Managing Large-Scale Projects
=============================


readibility is orthogonal to well-written code


Code where the coding is simplest.

.. code::

  class bar(foo):
      ANSWER = 42

Placing code at class scope invites a bunch of questions

So avoid placing elements at class scope unless you have no alternative.
