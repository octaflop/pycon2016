X12: enveloped by records. Then a functional grouping of transaction sets.

Why do claims take so long: that's the way we've always done it.

"Like pulling weeds all day in one corner of a large field". Too focused on specs.

Interactive evaluations to snippets and tests.


Reduce remaining code duplication. Functions to classes. Optimize based on real world metrics. Call the tractor back if another pass is needed.

Context managers can keep things modular.

Decoartors are a way to contextualize functions and methods.

``@matches_segment('EB', conditions={'EB01': 'C'})``

Generators: keep things out of memeory ‚Äî stream to reduce memory footprint.
You can also chain decoartors together.

PyPy: a way to speed stuff up significantly up.

Very good community standards.
